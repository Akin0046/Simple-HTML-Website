        <p>Hi,may name is Alvan Akin. I am currently an international student from <strong>Nigeria.</strong> I came to
            Canada as a
            diplomat when I was 13, and have spent my time in Canada furthering my education and intergrating myself
            into my community. </p>

        <p>My life has been full of ups and downs for the last 4 years, they have managed to be the best and worst years
            of my life at the same time. I consider myself to be an optimistic individual and I alwasy try to stay
            positive in the face of adversity.</p>

        <p>List of my hobbies</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drumming</li>
            <li>Cycling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here's a quote I love by <cite>Uncle Ben </cite> </p>
